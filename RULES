Top rule - first one should be autofilled. This one contains your INSTALLED roblox version - the one downloaded.
Bottom rule - second one should copy mine below. If this doesnt work, replace the V2.597.000 with the current roblox version. Should work with V2.597.000 tho

Replace the underscores here with the version downloaded.
